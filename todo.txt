features
- Shop
- Pathfinding
- talking to NPCs
-- dialogue options
- Loading Screen

- Sprites
-- behavior priority system
-- drawing priority/layer system
-- add a z dimension to the position (used for flying, jumping etc)

- Cutscene command system (modular)
-- Command_MoveToPath(target, posX, posY, duration) // benutzt pathfinding
-- Command_ShowTextbox(text, target)  // target fÃ¼r Sprechblase
-- Command_CameraPan(x, y, duration) // camera pans towards a target position (and then back?)

- Items
-- REFACTOR: item data, key and name handling is getting messy
-- Unify Item and ItemData structs: 
-- "Item" is only the key and a pointer to ItemData
-- "items" is a hash map instead of a vector
-- ItemData.h and ItemData.cpp
-- add PASSIVE and KEY item types
-- InventoryManager should not be a scene (update and draw are unused) but instead a property of Game

- Misc
-- 

- Music/Sounds:
-- Inventory select item --> different sound

TODO: refactor
- add a "persistent" property to event listeners (non-persistent listeners are removed after one event)
- enemies should seperate (collision detection)
- Remove all coupling between Game and Sprite?
- Game.walls a vector of Wall objects? add a "collides" property?
- use sprites in inventory?
- a way to control the page break of a text box
- items.json if the items get more complex
- when predrawing the Tilemap chunks, don't store textures that are completely transparent
- does it make sense for Behaviors to have a draw method, or can this be solved differently?
- no event listeners check for delayed events with callbacks

BUGS:
- RandomWalkBehavior: choose new target after some time if the current target can't be reached
- npc can follow the player across rooms, set position correctly near the door
- npc dialogue broken after cutscene
- GameOver Music does not start if a previous music has been playing
- show item pickup for all collectibles

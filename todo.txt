TODO: refactor
- add a "persistent" property to event listeners (non-persistent listeners are removed after one event)
- Remove all coupling between Game and Sprite?
- Game.walls a vector of Wall objects? add a "collides" property?
- use sprites in inventory?
- when predrawing the Tilemap chunks, don't store textures that are completely transparent
- does it make sense for Behaviors to have a draw method, or can this be solved differently?
- don't check event listeners for delayed events with callbacks
- add a "unique" property to addListener that removes old listeners if they exist
- posOffsetX and posOffsetY in weapons data currently unused
- Weapon hurtbox should appear only a fraction of the weapon's lifetime
- Can repeated events go infinite?
- Error check for a wrong emitter texture key
- create a particles.json file with presets for Particles and Emitters. Give Particle and Emitter a .fromData() function
- Event keys should be enums instead of strings
- Sprite.jump() method: add argument "jumpHeight" that roughly corresponds to the number of pixels


BUGS:
- RandomWalkBehavior: choose new target after some time if the current target can't be reached
- show item pickup for all collectibles
- does Sprite.jump() work as intended?
- door in room 002 does not open from event "door001open" when triggered from another room
- doors can't be opened from above (hitbox bug)


RELEASE CHECKLIST

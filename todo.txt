TODO: refactor
- add a "persistent" property to event listeners (non-persistent listeners are removed after one event)
- enemies should seperate (collision detection)
- Remove all coupling between Game and Sprite?
- Game.walls a vector of Wall objects? add a "collides" property?
- use sprites in inventory?
- a way to control the page break of a text box
- when predrawing the Tilemap chunks, don't store textures that are completely transparent
- does it make sense for Behaviors to have a draw method, or can this be solved differently?
- no event listeners check for delayed events with callbacks
- add PASSIVE and KEY items to inventory

BUGS:
- RandomWalkBehavior: choose new target after some time if the current target can't be reached
- npc can follow the player across rooms, set position correctly near the door
- npc dialogue broken after cutscene
- GameOver Music does not start if a previous music has been playing
- show item pickup for all collectibles
- F5 does not reset inventory
- hurtbox offset from weapons.json does nothing

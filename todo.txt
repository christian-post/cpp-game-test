features
- HUD

- Inventory
- Collectible Items
- Sprites
-- behavior priority system
-- sprite state that can change based on events (e.g. a door changes from being closed to being open)
- Cutscene command system (modular)
-- Command_MoveToPath(target, posX, posY, duration) // benutzt pathfinding
-- Command_ShowTextbox(text, target)  // target für Sprechblase
-- Command_CameraPan(x, y, duration) // camera pans towards a target position (and then back?)
- Tweens

TODO misc
- rename "gameStates" dir to "scenes"
- "defeat all enemies" event that unlocks a door to the next room
- npc can follow the player across rooms

TODO: refactor
- how textures are loaded for sprites from the Tiled Map data (more modular)

BUGS:
- RandomWalkBehavior: choose new target after some time if the current target can't be reached
- Behavior priorities/swiching is messy
- read access violation when multiple sprites are dying at the same time
- Letterbox Command should always draw while the cutscene is on

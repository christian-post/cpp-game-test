features
- chests with items (ChestOpenBehavior shows the item and starts a dialog)
- Pathfinding
- talking to NPCs
-- dialogue options
- locked doors and keys

- Dungeon Generation
-- steps:
-- 1 define general shape and layout (differently sized and connected rooms)
-- 2 gameplay flow 
--- 2.1 define number keys and locked doors --> pathfinding
--- 2.2 define location of mini bosses and end boss
--- 2.3 secret areas (maybe a shop or a secret item)
-- 3 remove unnecessary rooms after assignment
-- 4 Tiling: 
--- 4.1 create a floor and a wall layer
--- 4.2 choose the correct tiles based on their position and their neighbors (place predefined tile chunks?)
--- 4.3 maybe use wavefunction collapse?
--- 4.4 safe individual rooms as serialized data (JSON during development, and binary in release) to ensure they are persistant

- Sprites
-- behavior priority system
-- drawing priority/layer system
-- add a z dimension to the position (used for flying, jumping etc)

- Cutscene command system (modular)
-- Command_MoveToPath(target, posX, posY, duration) // benutzt pathfinding
-- Command_ShowTextbox(text, target)  // target fÃ¼r Sprechblase
-- Command_CameraPan(x, y, duration) // camera pans towards a target position (and then back?)

- Misc
-- 

- Music/Sounds:
-- Inventory select item --> different sound

TODO: refactor
- add a "persistent" property to event listeners (non-persistent listeners are removed after one event)
- enemies should seperate (collision detection)
- Remove all coupling between Game and Sprite?
- Game.walls a vector of Wall objects? add a "collides" property?
- use sprites in inventory?
- a way to control the page break of a text box
- when predrawing the Tilemap chunks, don't store textures that are completely transparent
- does it make sense for Behaviors to have a draw method, or can this be solved differently?
- no event listeners check for delayed events with callbacks
- add PASSIVE and KEY items to inventory

BUGS:
- RandomWalkBehavior: choose new target after some time if the current target can't be reached
- npc can follow the player across rooms, set position correctly near the door
- npc dialogue broken after cutscene
- GameOver Music does not start if a previous music has been playing
- show item pickup for all collectibles
- F5 does not reset inventory

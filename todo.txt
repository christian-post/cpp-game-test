features
- HUD
- Sound!
- Inventory

- Sprites
-- behavior priority system
-- drawing priority/layer system
-- sprite state that can change based on events (e.g. a door changes from being closed to being open)
-- "hurt" sprite (invisible) that deals damage similar to an enemy hurtbox

- Cutscene command system (modular)
-- Command_MoveToPath(target, posX, posY, duration) // benutzt pathfinding
-- Command_ShowTextbox(text, target)  // target für Sprechblase
-- Command_CameraPan(x, y, duration) // camera pans towards a target position (and then back?)

TODO: refactor
- add a "persistent" property to event listeners (non-persistent listeners are removed after one event)
- enemies should seperate (collision detection)
- Remove all coupling between Game and Sprite?
- Game.walls a vector of Wall objects? add a "collides" property?
- use sprites in inventory?
- tilesets: texture sampling instead of having one texture for each tile
- a way to control the page break of a text box
- items.json if they get more complex

BUGS:
- RandomWalkBehavior: choose new target after some time if the current target can't be reached
- Behavior priorities/swiching is messy
- door status should persist across teleports
- npc can follow the player across rooms, set position correctly near the door

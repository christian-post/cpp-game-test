The text should also contain various characters and punctuation to ensure that it displays correctly in different scenarios. By the way, does the form feed work?\fLet's see how well this works out in practice, shall we? Let's keep going until we reach a point where we can be sure that the text wrapping is functioning as expected. Now some very long words: hyperquantilicious, or transmogrification, ultracrepidarianism, maybe pseudophilosophical, and counterevolutionary."
